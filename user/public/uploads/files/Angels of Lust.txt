In the darkness we born
God has left us
Now there is only one
Who is here for us

Only, they hear us
They see us
Angels of Lust
We live for their lies

There is no escape
From this darkness
In this darkness
Angels of Lust gave us light

Angels of Lust
They give us passion
Angels of Lust
They give us pleasure

Now in this darkness
We are their slaves
We cannot escpae
We cannot be saved
